<p>I enjoy fostering connection and community with others.</p>-----
<p>The listserve is an opportunity to have global reach, and to be reached globally. I think there's great potential for this, and there's an opportunity to help it reach it's height!</p>-----
<p>I have often learned more from strangers.</p>-----
<p>I think the concept of the ListServe is cool -- I like the idea of community and story-telling, but I wonder how many people just delete the emails or never read them. 

I want to know why the ListServe failed to live up to people's expectations.</p>-----
<p>I've shared the idea of the Listserve with a lot of people. Some are initially interested only to relegate the emails to their spam folder relatively quickly.

Others, though, love it as much as I do. And we talk about the emails that interest us.

I am curious to see how this evolves. I was also drawn in by the design thinking.</p>-----
<p>I like working with diverse groups of people, I like the Listserve and would be curious to know about others who also enjoy it.</p>-----
<p>Just keen to observe what people might do.</p>-----
<p>I backpacked through Europe and met up with people I met online this past summer! I love being connected to strangers on the internet.</p>-----
<p>It could potentially be great. It could change the world.</p>-----
<p>Because this is what I was planning to do if I ever won! It's a tremendous community of listeners and storytellers that has organically grown and had a lot of potential. Thank you fort doing this!</p>-----
<p>interested in learning more about language processing</p>-----
<p>I have been challenging myself to try new things for the past few years.  I have always loved the idea of projects like this which are community driven, though I have never had the opportunity to participate in the past.  I am also interested in improving my programming skills and learning more about how projects like these are managed, so this seemed like a good time to join.

</p>-----
<p>Because it might be something more than the same old "Change the world by making new ways to order in food and more places to complain about Politics" Internet Drivel.

Man, I miss Andrew Sullivan's Dish blog. It was damn near the only thing on the Internet not completely biased or full of blatant lies and clickbait apparently - I haven't found anything near it's quality since they retired it.</p>-----
<p>The Listserve has a lot of potential for experimentation and we can learn a lot by playing with it, yet its essential nature is untouchable and it can easily be reverted to its basic operation.</p>-----
<p>Honestly I don't know. It seems a bit out there, and could </p>-----
<p>The design thinking part really caught my eye. Also, I thought it would be fun to have pen pals.</p>-----
<p>I like ideas. I like to make them happen. Plus i have an un-natural curiosity about everything</p>-----
<p>what can a group of people with very very loose connections achieve?</p>-----
<p>It's a whole new level of creativity, working in such a group of kinda like-minded people, who found eachother rather serendipidously but can create a wonderful project together.</p>-----
<p>because it might be interesting</p>-----
<p>I like it's potential to create something cool. I also like that the project has the ability to bring similar interesting people together. Aaaand I like how the project is a mechanism for learning about design thinking. </p>-----
<p>I like design discussions centered around improving community and connection. We'll see where this goes, but I am expecting good conversation.</p>-----
<p>I'm currently finishing my post grad study in interaction design. We use design thinking for most of our projects and listserver is such a good and simple idea, I would love to see the kind of experience we can create together.</p>-----
<p>I'm not sure where it could lead, but trying something new and potentially being a part of building something great sounds exciting. </p>-----
<p>i love initiating things and moving them forward</p>-----
<p>The call-to-action speaks to me... particularly this section: "We think of every message as a pebble dropped in a lake. What’s interesting isn’t the pebble itself, but the ripples it causes. In short, it’s an opportunity to experiment with the world."</p>-----
<p>I'm curious about any mass communication platform - most of my professional life has been spent working on structured platforms (as a journalist, analyst, video game designer). 

I'm interested in the idea of an ordinary person "winning" the chance to be seen. 

I found Listserve to be initially an exciting idea, but ultimately too open-ended and directionless to be interesting.</p>-----
<p>I would love to learn to participate in such a project and use the ideas in my own pursuit of a Ph.D.</p>-----
<p>I guess the same curiousity that brought me to the listserve</p>-----
<p>What else do I have to do</p>-----
<p>I am curious about what will come together... 
Interested in seeing what develops and if it will be of interest to me. I decided to check it out and then I can decide if I want to participate.</p>-----
<p>I want to see design thinking in action.</p>-----
<p>I think people are our greatest resource. Our mind has so much potential and imagine what we could do with that potential x 200 (or more!). I think this project can help accomplish just that. </p>-----
<p>I like to go deep into things that I have interest.</p>-----
<p>I like the idea of taking the best of what the listserve could be and concentrating on making it better and more distilled.</p>-----
<p>I think the Listserve has the potential to be much bigger than it is and I love design thinking challenges. </p>-----
<p>It blows my mind of the possibilities that could be done using the Listserve medium. I want to be a part of that. Also, I've always wanted to be a part of creating something that would benefit a large number of people. This could be it.</p>-----
<p>It spoke to me. In the world we live in today, there's no way a united, educated, and active group of 25,000 people can't come together for something more</p>-----
<p>The ListServe is a novel communications channel. I like novel communications channel, they yield novel information.</p>-----
<p>It's different </p>-----
<p>I'd like to see what else the Listserve can do by the people who use the Listserve</p>-----
<p>Listserve has been a great addition to my daily e-mails and I hope to be able to contribute back by improving it.</p>-----
<p>Because people with one really good idea sometimes come up with more good ideas.</p>-----
<p>
Love.</p>-----
<p>there is a lack of people interested in listening to other people's ideas - this seems like an exception</p>-----
<p>I'm not exactly sure. I love traveling and connecting with different people. Sometimes it feels like an easier way to do this -minus the food, smells, and sights of being in a different location. </p>-----
<p>It honestly just seemed like a cool idea.</p>-----
<p>Because I love the idea of  listening to random strangers and talking to many people.</p>-----
<p>I have no idea what this could turn into, which is intriguing, and interested to see what a massive open source project will work and what it will develop.</p>-----
<p>Life goal is to "Leave my campground better than when I found it."  This could be a chance to pay it forward.</p>-----
<p>I'm not exactly sure yet. I love the idea of harnessing the people power of the Listserve. Being able to occasionally pepper the airwaves with updates on this group, while also soliciting more participants, is appealing to me. Providing something unique to the Listservians that may eventually attract greater numbers of people to the list is also quite intriguing.

And bettering society is certainly something that I want in on, if that's on the table. If it's just for funsies, I'm still curious as well.</p>-----
<p>I just love creative projects like this, especially ones that foster connection.</p>-----
<p>not sure, 202 is a great number</p>-----
<p>Because most of the opportunities I get to help make things come through work, where the desired end-state is more constrained.  This seems like a particularly intriguing possibility to help make something good and to work with people who are smarter than I am -- both of which are opportunities one shouldn't pass up.</p>-----
<p>To try and disrupt things </p>-----
<p>The potential is huge.  Even without knowing what will occur, there's lots of upside to this.  </p>-----
<p>i thought if someone identified a problem - say this 'family in my home town is going through difficult time and needs help' - we could come up with ways to help them, donations of things or money.
or find answers to other more broad problems in the world - just brainstorming with such a diverse group would be interesting</p>-----
<p>i'd like to explore ways to increase engagement in the listserve community. to create incentives and structures for both writers and listeners to follow up and talk, work, and learn together.</p>-----
<p>I am always drawn to doing something new and exciting and different from what I normally would be drawn to. I have no idea the direction (or even the purpose) of this project, and it makes me want to be a huge part of it. </p>-----
<p>I enjoy problem solving.  Being able to contribute to an open source group could be fun and beneficial.</p>-----
<p>it seems disruptive and revotutionary..</p>-----
<p>I'm always supporting project that make people be united in something positive.</p>-----
<p>I want to see a better world created and maybe the people associated with this initiative might move things in a good direction.</p>-----
<p>25k audience, my background in software dev and fascination with human behaviour.</p>-----
<p>I've been interested in design thinking but don't know too much about it, and I want to contribute to the listserve in some way! </p>-----
<p>Because the world is in great need of smart, concerned people working to solve a problem that doesn't involve making money for themselves</p>-----
<p>I love community and connections between people who wouldn't know each other or have reason to connect other than this platform. </p>-----
<p>I'd like to see the Listserve evolve to the "next level". Something more engaging and meaningful.</p>-----
<p>An opportunity to connect with a global network of people who just want to have a voice </p>-----
<p>I love the excitement that come from randomness. I don't think I have enough of it on the internet. I liken the experience to walking around and finding books at the library or cool things on the side of the road.
Granted, most of the time is normal, but there are wonderful things here and there.  

There is a good amount of excitement and surprise about finding but the internet can be very commercial so It's a lot about buying things. There is also that bubble created by an internet that wants to market things to me based on my history, and myself, just looking at things I want to look at. A self reinforcing bubble. This project is like a humble attempt at popping that bubble sometimes.</p>-----
<p>I like new things, i want to start being part of something outside of my little world and i'm guessing i'll learn stuff that i wouldn't learn at school or somewhere

and i'm taking a class of entrepreneurship at college and i would love to wide my knowledge about real life situations

and i'm curious</p>-----
<p>It sounded awesome when I read the email and again, I love the whole idea of the listserve. I wish my response was deeper. </p>-----
<p>I think it would be cool to work on a distributed team on a project (though I am a bit skeptical of our potential)
I like to participate in Listserve activities -- and want to enable others to do the same.</p>-----
<p>I am an American who has lived in Taiwan for nearly a decade.  I recently started up a co-working space and cross-cultural training center.  I spend a lot of time introducing expats to Taiwanese culture and Taiwanese to western logic and thinking.  Having access to 25,000 multicultural trains of thought would be immensely useful to build a better training program.</p>-----
<p>I really like applying design thinking principles to non-technical projects.</p>-----
<p>I am currently taking a Community Organizing class in my graduate program which has gotten me thinking a lot about the issues we face and what steps we can take to try and solve those issues. I never thought of the Listserve as a "community", however, we must have some shared value that has led us to want to sign up for this. So we must be a community! Which means we can accomplish some sort of positive change in a world with problems that seem impossible to tackle alone.</p>-----
<p>I'm not really a very social person, but I'm comfortable reaching out from behind a computer</p>-----
<p>I believe this to be a very unique and interesting opportunity to be a part of
transforming a piece of our world.  </p>-----
<p>The opportunity to 'meet' new people, learning, exchanging ideas, learning</p>-----
<p>The internet changed the world, new inituatives like the listserve have the potential to add to this!</p>-----
<p>Looking to help people has always been my motto. So if we can build something that would help us, I don't see any reason for me not being a part of it.

I'm always on the lookout for a change and interesting stuff to do so when this came up, I had no option but to go for it.
</p>-----
<p>It is fascinating for me to see what and how people think. I love observing people. I am interested in anythign related to people. The listserve is a good idea so I am sure other ideas from the maker willl be interesting too. </p>-----
<p>Again, the idea.</p>-----
<p>Excited to see what can be created among the team of people with same and different hobbies.</p>-----
<p>I like to experiment with media, especially media that connects people.  I also teach in the department that students who created the listserve were in when they created it.</p>-----
<p>I always like to see things improve, Listserve (to my knowledge) hasn't done that. So here is a chance to collaborate with unique and hopefully cool people to improve something that touches many lives. </p>-----
<p>I like anything new that can show me a new
Perspective on life. </p>-----
<p>I like the idea of nontraditional communities.</p>-----
<p>curious, can contribute to something bigger
working with others for the same outcome</p>-----
<p>I'm curious as to how the listserve could be evolved because, at the moment, it seems to be a fairly stable series of shouts into the void with little binding community aside from base membership itself.</p>-----
<p>Retired and can make some time</p>-----
<p>To see where it leads and if I learn anything</p>-----
<p>To evolve the idea of the Listserve, which feels like a wonderful promise that could be even greater with some kind of tweaking.</p>-----
<p>To participate in making the Listserve more connected</p>-----
<p>Communication between people is a precious commodity in the midst of divisive days.</p>-----
<p>I'm always interested in working with/helping interesting projects and the Listserve is one of the most interesting and original online projects that I've come across. </p>-----
<p>Because I think there is something powerful that can be done with the right people who are creative and interested in doing something meaningful, and are ok with working with strangers and comfortable things</p>-----
<p>A lot of what I do as a consumer researcher involves design thinking and understanding what human beings really want and how they interact with the world around them and how to make objects and experiences better integrated with these. To apply this process to something like the Listserve would be fascinating, and allow me to give back to a project or initiative that has given me a lot.</p>-----
<p>It has potential to turn into something interesting and I'd like to embark on a hobby project, meet new people, etc. </p>-----
<p>I've always been an amateur sociologist.  For a while I've been chipping away on a personal photo project, 100 strangers. Photogs around the world approach 100 different strangers and get consent to take their photo and also get a soundbite from them. Here's minehttps://www.flickr.com/photos/59949757@N06/albums/72157629139123186

I think there is a way to incorporate some components of 100 strangers into the listerve.   </p>-----
<p>Not sure yet if I am. I love connecting with people and was intrigued by your email. If it continues to intrigue me I'll have a better answer for you. I also like being involved in interesting things that most people aren't involved in. </p>-----
<p>I'm curious where it will go, and it's interesting to me to see where it might lead.  I've mostly been a passive viewer of the listserve, even when people ask for connection I never give it, so here's me, throwing myself out in the world to see what it brings back.</p>-----
<p>I find the idea facinating. I always like to do new things and to get in on the ground floor of this project should give me an opportunity to contribute and to learn. What more can oneaskmfor?</p>-----
<p>I think it's an opportunity to learn and create something new. It's an opportunity to propose ideas and dreams to people who might help you to realize them.</p>-----
<p>I'm interested in people, logistics, systems and research. </p>-----
<p>I like making. I like connecting. I need to have a voice in something because I've had so little agency for too long.</p>-----
<p>I like listserve and I wanted an interesting project to apply the design thinking principle I had picked up.</p>-----
<p>I have always be curious about ways of unlocking the people's potential. Also in engaging with people who are same passionate about bringing good to the world. When such an opportunity arises I cannot miss it.</p>-----
<p>The Listserve has been really interesting to be a part of and the idea of learning with other people to create something new is really compelling.</p>-----
<p>nan</p>-----
<p>I believe in this community and want to make it better for everyone.</p>-----
<p>Because there is always room for improvement. Change is inevitable, being thoughtful about it might make it change for the better. Our, we could muck it up. But that's ok, too. Either way, it'll be interesting! </p>-----
<p>Evolution</p>-----
<p>Because the possibility of doing something great always excites me. Doing it with great people is even more interesting! Working online is also quite new to me, I would love to get more experience in it.</p>-----
<p>I always like to be involved. Specifically, I'd like to help generate new ideas for the Listserve and help grow the audience, both in size and engagement level. </p>-----
<p>I'd like to see a more robust relationship happen where people are communicating and working with one another to understand each other on a level deeper than the surface.</p>-----
<p>Your email hooked me, and design thinking sounds interesting. Also I'm passionate about the Listserve and would be interested in whatever direction it takes next</p>-----
<p>I want to help create something cool. I don't think I create enough.</p>-----
