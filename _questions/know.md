<p>I know a lot about Japan and sociology. I also know a lot about determination.</p>-----
<p>wonder</p>-----
<p>Minimalist Art
</p>-----
<p>Umm... I know a lot about running and training for things, a lot about self-discipline, a little bit about history and marketing.  A lot about social media. </p>-----
<p>I've worked in marketing for ~10 years. I wouldn't say that I'm wildly passionate about it, but I think I have learned a great deal about communication, branding and mass appeal.</p>-----
<p>Managing/organizing projects; accessible technology, design of educational tools</p>-----
<p>Computers, Progressive Rock, Soccer</p>-----
<p>social media for tech companies</p>-----
<p>Design in general, including but not limited to user experience design. South Africa and the lessons we have learned. Corporate culture. How to fuck up a relationship. </p>-----
<p>Web development, Mandarin Chinese language, constructed languages, refugees, community organizing.</p>-----
<p>Electronic design</p>-----
<p>I'm pretty good in MATLAB, MathCAD, and have a little experience in VBA (but it's been a long time since I've used it).
I also have a good amount of experience using different CAD software

I know a lot about the history of traditional American Folk music, and learning more about it and its history has become a minor obsession lately.

I know a fair amount about elevators (I work for an elevator company) and sometimes use design thinking in my work to find solutions to problems encountered by mechanics and technicians in the field. 

I'm not sure how much of this can help me contribute to the project, but I'm a quick learner if anything seems "close enough" to something else that would directly apply.</p>-----
<p>Despair

OK and Adobe Creative Cloud apps, InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator.</p>-----
<p>Storytelling.</p>-----
<p>tech and sports and food, but I'm pretty knowledgeable about a lot of things</p>-----

<p>Marketing and sales; i speak 5 languages fluently
</p>-----
<p>I've organized quite a few events in my day -- generally interdisciplinary in nature -- and am really good at planning and administrative stuff. I have a fair base of knowledge on a lot of practical things but am not really good with names and places and specifics because my memory isn't the best. :)</p>-----
<p>Video games, tech, assorted history and anthropology, trivia</p>-----
<p>Plants, ecophysiology, academia, psychology, a select few actors and musicians

<p>Global Health and International Development</p>-----
<p>Healthcare, healthcare regulations, pharmaceuticals, neuroscience (science in general), psychology & cognitive neuroscience. </p>-----
<p>Hard to answer, since I think you never know everything about anything, there is always something to learn. So my answer is not what I know most about, but what I study more about and that is advertising.</p>-----
<p>Languages. May not be useful to our task, but I have working fluency in French and Spanish, and basic Portuguese. 

Actually, thinking of an answer here makes me wonder if I know much about anything. I'm a good trivia player because I know a little about a lot, but I'm not so sure I know a lot about any particular thing.</p>-----
<p>Storytelling. </p>-----
<p>I'm a professional and experienced market research analyst with 7 years experience. My areas of expertise include: competitive intelligence, market analysis, industry analysis, country analysis, SWOT analysis, strategy analysis, company profiling, people profiling, competitor profiling, and lead generation. Currently, I'm a data analyst for a market research firm in which I do collective data analysis using SPSS. </p>-----

<p>

<p>next generation video platforms</p>-----
<p>I'm not so much an expert in anything so much as a "Jack of all trades, master of none." </p>-----
<p>I don't have a true area of expertise to be honest. I'm a student studying business and Spanish, but I really enjoy public speaking and current events (I'm on the Model United Nations team and am a former debater).</p>-----
<p>Psychology</p>-----
<p>Story. I am a screenwriter and story consultant, who has helped with everything from documentaries, to movies, to musicals, to live storytelling.</p>-----

<p>Grammar and spelling, extreme metal music, psychedelics, online advertising, Wordpress, polyamory, politics, and social justice.</p>-----
<p>I know a lot about thought awareness, taking action, breaking things down into simple parts. I am a wonderful listener and I can see very quickly through people's stories. I know a lot about making big changes - moving, travel, big leaps, committing to big projects. It's what I enjoy talking to people about.</p>-----

<p>Books and bookselling, editing (prose), digital reading experiences, sundry bits of trivia.</p>-----

<p>I have many knives, none of them are sharp. I have much experience with plants and animals, and with people, as a mother, grandmother, former hippie-commune-dweller, and mail carrier.

<p>Fabrication techniques -or how to make things-. I love materials and methods and I'm always thinking about it and experimenting with new things.</p>-----
<p>i'm not a very confident person, so my first thought was 'nothing', 
but i have a wide interest:
- in people's needs and wants 
- facts about random stuff 

 maybe theres a big list of stuff i know very well but in everything that comes to my mind i see spots where i might be lacking important info

</p>-----
<p>In terms of technology, I would like to believe that I am an expert googler, I am usually able to find any and everything on google. I think that is a talent. More seriously, project development (service related projects) from a grassroots level. </p>-----
<p>Ugh this is a tough question. I skipped it and came back to it and I still don't know. I know a lot of trivia about world history, science, philosophy, geography... I'm okay at programming. User Centred Design? It's hard to compare these areas of knowledge, and impossible to say whether I know more in any of these fields than anybody else in the group.</p>-----
