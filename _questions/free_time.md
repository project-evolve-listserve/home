<p>I read. I have knowledge FOMO (fear of missing out) and want to spend my time processing as much information as possible. 

I also like to hike and climb mountains, I don't know what it is about getting to the top of a mountain or killer view - but it's very satisfying. </p> -----
<p>What is this "free time" you speak of?

With Day Job and Parenting routines dominating my day from 6:30a until 10p, my remaining non-sleeping hours are a 4a-6:30a block.

Listserve Design Thinking will likely be slotted atop that list.</p> -----

Reading  
Board games with my friends

Travel adventures 
Ashtanga yoga
And tea.</p> -----
