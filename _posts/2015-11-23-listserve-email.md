The Listserve was a class project started in 2012 by five NYU Technology and Communications Graduate students.

Originator Alvin Chang in a Medium post weighed in on the design of the project:

"For most people, the Listserve is a daily e-mail from a stranger. But there are more facets to the experiment that we hope people play with. When someone wins the Listserve, they don’t just win the ability to send an e-mail to 25,000 people. The value of this opportunity lies in several mechanisms:

- The synchronous nature: It’s all sent at once, and many people will read it at the same time.
- The blank canvas: Sure, we only allow text. But what you do with the text doesn’t have to stay within the bounds of the e-mail, or within the bounds of the form. (‘Text’ ≠ ‘Words’)
- The feedback: We think of every message as a pebble dropped in a lake. What’s interesting isn’t the pebble itself, but the ripples it causes.

In short, it’s an opportunity to experiment with the world."

*So, my question is, how can we use the Listserve in a more profound way, beyond telling stories, finding more about each other and the society we live in. Essentially, how might we 'evolve' the Listserve from how it currently exists?*

My idea is to approach this using Design Thinking. Design Thinking is a powerful tool used by innovators to find solutions to problems. Design Thinking is commonly used as a two stage iterative process that seeks to 1) find the ‘right’ problem and 2) find A solution in a way that meets human needs and capabilities.

To start any Design Thinking project you must first a) define a goal and b) assemble a team.

- Our Goal? Learn from what the Listserve has accomplished, iterate on different designs for innovative communication products, build ‘something’ that has an impact.
- Team: We’re the team. I believe just being on the Listserve is a strong signal for one’s level of creative curiosity - I’m confident we’ll be able to put together an interesting group of people.

Let’s learn from something new together. If you’re interested in participating in this project please email me at <mailto:ProjectEvolveListserve@gmail.com>. You can expect about one email a week as we get started.

Here we go!
