Hello everyone, 

Thank you for expressing interest in the idea to evolve the Listserve. 202 people from the Listserve community share the opinion that it would be fun and interesting to apply design thinking to create our own project with the Listserve as a launchpad. 

#### How might we evolve the Listserve?

What is the Listserve? It has 25,000 readers, who are they? What do they get out of it? Does it bring them enjoyment? What are they looking for? Do they find it? Do they use it to escape? Does it make them think? Or rather, does it make them feel? 

Design thinking will help us answer these questions and give us a better understanding of the Listserve. Then, we will use our insights to generate ideas for what we should build ourselves. This is project to find out how we can advance the existing Listserve, and do it. 

#### About me and my motivations:

My name is [Chris Stanley](http://stanleychris2.github.io/home/). I live in Los Angeles, currently a freelance data scientist. I’m 26, studied Economics and Psychology at Yale, worked on Wall St., and most recently transitioned my failed startup into an open source project. 

I’ve always been intrigued with the Listserve--this anonymous email list, cultural exchange community, internet communication project all in one. I wanted to undertake this project because I think that there is a good chance we can create something that people love, a personal goal of mine. 

#### How we do it:

I’ve received emails from a collection of interesting people - a University lecturer in Vietnam, UX designers, a screenwriter in Los Angeles, a cognitive psychologist in NYC, and a freelance blogger in France are just a few that immediately come to mind… the list goes on. I’m impressed by the number of people who took the time to reach out. 

Because we have so many talented people willing to spend time on this project, I wanted to make sure I organized the group in a way that everyone can be engaged, heard, and contribute as much as they like. Originally, I had thought of weekly emails and surveys from me to all 200 people, but I now think that falls short on many levels. 

Divide the 200 people willing to participate into small teams of 8-15 people. Each team will have the creative freedom to execute the project in the best way they see fit. I will work with teams to help develop shared resources to give scope and definition to the project to ensure everyone’s projects are on the right track. 

#### Survey:

As a first step, I’d like to get a better idea of our group. Many people responded with detailed information, others responded with an enthusiastic “Count me in!” I will use this survey to learn about your interests in the project and also learn about your feelings towards the Listserve. We’ll also use survey responses to help organize teams as to ensure multidisciplinary and diverse teams.

This has the potential to be an extremely powerful project with a group of talented people who are going to spend their free time devoted to building something people love. Awesome!

Cheers, 

Chris Stanley
