### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>I spend time with my family; wife and 3 kids aged 12, 10 and 8 and a dog. I also travel a lot throughout Europe for work and vacations which my wife plans. I read, mostly for pleasure. </p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>UX Design, evolutionary biology, general science topics, a little chess</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>Varied stories the anticipation that I might find someone or something interesting</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>References to religious convictions</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>It has potential to turn into something interesting and I'd like to embark on a hobby project, meet new people, etc. </p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>What, if anything has the listserve done to make people's lives better or to alleviate suffering? Has there been any significant impact? If not, why not. Aside from creating a platform for lottery style mass communication could there be some other objective? I guess this is party the domain of this project...</p>
