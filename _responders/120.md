<p>Teaching English as a foreign language.Making do in new countries, researching, getting acclimated. Framing compelling stories. </p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>Arrogance, small-mindedness, immaturity. Inanity. </p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>It's an opt-in of people that want to collaborate. Motivation can make beautiful things happen. </p>

### Age
<p>Why do bad messages happen to good people?</p>
