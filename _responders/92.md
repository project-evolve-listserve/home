### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Read books, cook, learn and travel. Also, video games as a guilty pleasure!</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>The biological sciences and sales/selling</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>It has a chance for greatness, every day. It comes as a surprise even still; a small hit of Christmas morning. Also on a meta level it speaks to what is on the mind of a self-selected group of people.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>So many responses from smug, narrow-minded young people defining themselves by their self-centered awareness and their book/TV/movie recommendations. Also, nobody ever writes back.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>To evolve the idea of the Listserve, which feels like a wonderful promise that could be even greater with some kind of tweaking.</p>

### Age
<p>Runing the Listserve for years, is there anything about it that you would like to tweak? (And why has it never really changed?)</p>
