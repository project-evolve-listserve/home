### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Reading everything and anything & traveling. </p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>social media for tech companies</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>The stories, of course.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>Lack of follow-up and feedback. As far as I know, once you write a Listserve, you only get feedback if people reach out to you directly.

Lack of an expected format. No TL;DR's.

No community where people can discuss after a Listserve.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I backpacked through Europe and met up with people I met online this past summer! I love being connected to strangers on the internet.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>What are the daily unsubscribe and open rates?</p>
