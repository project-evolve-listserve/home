### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Reading about all kinds of stuff (mostly life advice/hacks and tech products), play soccer, cycle, workout, learn new languages, watch QI (BBC).</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Startups, lean startups, Ruby on Rails</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>It's a moment to breathe during the day, and dream away about the lives of others on this planet we share. Apart from the music & book recommendations (which I personally really love) I get a small moment of escape during my day, grounding me and appreciating the life I live and share with others.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>That I didn't win yet!</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>It's a whole new level of creativity, working in such a group of kinda like-minded people, who found eachother rather serendipidously but can create a wonderful project together.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>How many active people (who read every email) are there on the Listserve?</p>
