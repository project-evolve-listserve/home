### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Read, walk</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Video games, tech, assorted history and anthropology, trivia</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>The rare email that doesn't fit the mold</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>The not-rare emails that are completely interchangeable (wow! I won! Now what! Here's my advice!)</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I'm curious about any mass communication platform - most of my professional life has been spent working on structured platforms (as a journalist, analyst, video game designer). 

I'm interested in the idea of an ordinary person "winning" the chance to be seen. 

I found Listserve to be initially an exciting idea, but ultimately too open-ended and directionless to be interesting.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>Does it concern you that the subscriber base barely grows and the format barely changes?</p>
