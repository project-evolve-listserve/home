### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Playing game called Go (check it out, the oldest game in the world!), reading, having deep conversations with people, self-reflecting, hiking, skiing. </p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Leadership. </p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>Insights from people. Random people! Deepness of words one rarely sees.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>That it's mostly popular in US. I wonder if we could popularize it to all the corners of the world. I wonder if there are other platforms similar to Listserve.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>Because the possibility of doing something great always excites me. Doing it with great people is even more interesting! Working online is also quite new to me, I would love to get more experience in it.</p>

### Age
<p>Who are you (beyond demographics)? What made you who you are today? What's your purpose in life? What are you most afraid of? What are you dreaming about?</p>
