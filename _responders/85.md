### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Read, play video or bored games, and generally spend time with people (or  animals)</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>MY general lack of knowledge? Umm I guess accounting is my trade but I just graduated so still not much. Maybe how to work hard and work well with other people. If that counts.</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>Although some are sad and others are jokes it is a glimpse into a completely different life which any one can use to help mold and shape their own views to be a more global person.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>It can get real sappy sometimes and they can just not be fun to read.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I always like to see things improve, Listserve (to my knowledge) hasn't done that. So here is a chance to collaborate with unique and hopefully cool people to improve something that touches many lives. </p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>It would probably have nothing to do with Listserve. Something about their family or favorite hobby. I mean they are a God, don;t you want to know what they do for fun?</p>
