### What do you know the most about?
<p>Humans</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>The fact that it reminds me of the "inexhaustible variety of life" </p>

<p>Some people get a bit too preachy, but I don't really not like that aspect bc I take it all in regardless</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>It spoke to me. In the world we live in today, there's no way a united, educated, and active group of 25,000 people can't come together for something more</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>What would you say to the 25,000 listservians in a similar email blast</p>
