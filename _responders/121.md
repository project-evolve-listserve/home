### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Make poems, music, and short films.</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>How to use the English language effectively.</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>Hearing diverse perspectives, useful advice, personal stories I wouldn't otherwise encounter in my little Internet confirmation-bias bubble.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>TONS of trite, saccharine emails that add absolutely nothing to my life. I'm seriously on the verge of unsubscribing. I'd rather get a really specific, vivid, personal email that's totally irrelevant to my interests than get a "God is great and your life matters" email ANY day.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I still think the Listserve has potential to effectively rally, instruct, edify, inspire, etc. - especially if we can do something to address this problem of Listserve posts never really speaking to each other across time.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>Why don't you allow links? Seriously, allow links. People can choose not to click on them if they want. Jeez.</p>
