### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>I like to read (mostly sci-fi, fantasy or about math). I also cook really basic stuff with my kids.</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Story. I am a screenwriter and story consultant, who has helped with everything from documentaries, to movies, to musicals, to live storytelling.</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>I like hearing about what people do, since I'm so accustomed to my own world.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>Many people seem to think that the listserve is a place to give advice about how to live a happy life. Advice is not that interesting to me.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I have no idea what this could turn into, which is intriguing, and interested to see what a massive open source project will work and what it will develop.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>Can you think of a way to use the Listserve to motivate people to do good?</p>
