### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Exercise (Crossfit); reading about productivity; traveling (especially internationally); kniting/sewing; watch TED talks!</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Managing/organizing projects; accessible technology, design of educational tools</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>Reading snippets of peoples lives and perspectives, and getting recommendations for things I wouldn't have known about otherwise.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>That most people start by saying how hard it is, and that they almost didn't submit anything. All the life advice...just tell me a bit about your story, I don't need to hear your advice, I can learn from your experience.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I like working with diverse groups of people, I like the Listserve and would be curious to know about others who also enjoy it.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>How many of the subscribers actually read the emails regularly.</p>
