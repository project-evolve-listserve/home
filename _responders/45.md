### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Read, play with my dog, cook, drink, travel. </p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>I'm not so much an expert in anything so much as a "Jack of all trades, master of none." </p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>I really like when people write their own stories, that are interesting. Regardless of their truths it's entertaining when people have a story to tell. </p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>When people merely complain or just flatly explain about their lives. C'mon people, get creative!</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I'm not exactly sure. I love traveling and connecting with different people. Sometimes it feels like an easier way to do this -minus the food, smells, and sights of being in a different location. </p>

### Age
<p>If they could forward me the one listserv that was the very oddly written story about the island. It's been my favorite since I had joined but it was accidentally purged from my email. </p>
