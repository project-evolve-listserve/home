### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>I fish, tie flies, crochet, see, read, walk the dog. </p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Being a good patent and a good single parent. How to make technology useful for regular (non-techie) adults. How to crochet. Fishing. </p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>At first, I liked the variety of posts. One of the first ones was a recipe, then a list of words that represent ideas that don't translate. I like the ones best  that are different, not lecturing about how to live a good life. </p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>Trying sooooooo hard to be profound. Snore. </p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>Because there is always room for improvement. Change is inevitable, being thoughtful about it might make it change for the better. Our, we could muck it up. But that's ok, too. Either way, it'll be interesting! </p>

### Age
<p>Are you still enjoying what you do? </p>
