### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Take photos, hang out with friends, ride my bike, photo and video projects to build up my portfolio </p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>The tech behind video and photo </p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>The randomness of it; getting points of view outside of my typical social and professional circle</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>Too many sob stories, or when it's too long </p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I've always been an amateur sociologist.  For a while I've been chipping away on a personal photo project, 100 strangers. Photogs around the world approach 100 different strangers and get consent to take their photo and also get a soundbite from them. Here's minehttps://www.flickr.com/photos/59949757@N06/albums/72157629139123186

I think there is a way to incorporate some components of 100 strangers into the listerve.   </p>

### Age
<p>Recipe ideas. I'm sure we could crowdsource some wicked casseroles. </p>
