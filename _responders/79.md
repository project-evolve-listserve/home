### What do you know the most about?
<p>Online marketing, Popular science (space & particle physics in specific), how to bake a killer chocolate chili cake</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>It's potential to connect people from all walks of life across the globe, eventually resulting in a wide variety of stories that allow for a far deepening of your own opinions on things</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>A "free-for-all" format can lead to super creative entries, but also to some less interesting stories. It also potentially loses its charm over a long period of time on the intense "once-a-day" frequency</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>The internet changed the world, new inituatives like the listserve have the potential to add to this!</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>Will I ever win? ;)</p>
