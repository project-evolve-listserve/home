### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Play with my son, spend time with my wife, cook, eat, garden, socialise with friends, read, watch stuff on Plex (on my iPad), take over the world. </p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Software development, full stack (servers through databases through enterprise software to UI/UX).  Running a business.  Growing a business.  Growing income exponentially without scaling resources.

I know a bit about philosophy and human behaviour as well.</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>The occasional raw, honest, vulnerable truth from someone.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>The often boring relative perspective advice.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>25k audience, my background in software dev and fascination with human behaviour.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>Why isn't the list growing?  It has hovered around 25K since I joined many years ago.</p>
