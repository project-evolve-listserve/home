### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>I'm a runner. Mostly half marathons but the occasional marathon. I advocate for education being the most powerful change agent that we have at our disposal for long term meaning full change.</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Design in general, including but not limited to user experience design. South Africa and the lessons we have learned. Corporate culture. How to fuck up a relationship. </p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>That winners have the potential to engage with a huge number of people emotionally. This could initiate change. In particular, social change. I feel that our world is in need of revolution.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>People waste the opportunity. Which I suppose is there perrogative.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>It could potentially be great. It could change the world.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>Why have you not created an engagement platform. You have created this amazing thing, and no tools to help people use it.</p>
