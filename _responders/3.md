### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Run! Aside from that-- be outside hiking/biking/walking around, read, explore in general.</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Umm... I know a lot about running and training for things, a lot about self-discipline, a little bit about history and marketing.  A lot about social media. </p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>I like that I get a glimpse into people lives, like a snapshot of who they are/how they are feeling at that exact moment. What they think is the most important to tell the world about themselves. </p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>Sometimes I feel like the emails are super generic-- platitudes on platitudes/self-help shit. Also when people send super cryptic poems is a bit annoying to me.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I think the concept of the ListServe is cool -- I like the idea of community and story-telling, but I wonder how many people just delete the emails or never read them. 

I want to know why the ListServe failed to live up to people's expectations.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>Did it turn out like they envisioned?</p>
