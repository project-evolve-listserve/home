### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>I love to get lost in a book, to craft gifts for people (mostly crochet), to cook and bake.</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Languages. May not be useful to our task, but I have working fluency in French and Spanish, and basic Portuguese. 

Actually, thinking of an answer here makes me wonder if I know much about anything. I'm a good trivia player because I know a little about a lot, but I'm not so sure I know a lot about any particular thing.</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>Because I love to read, I love it when the list serve is a well-written story, snippet, anecdote.

I also like it when an email is able to teach me about something I didn't know/ know much about.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>The emails that end up being a college "about me" essay, I don't enjoy.

</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I like the idea of taking the best of what the listserve could be and concentrating on making it better and more distilled.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>I'd ask what their vision of the listserve and what it could accomplish was when they started, and how what they see it as now compares.</p>
