### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>I was a dancer growing up, so dance is probably one of my favorite things to do. I also love hiking, biking, baking, going to the movies, and travelling any chance I get. NYC is my favorite place in the US, but I love vacationing in California.</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Probably technology and engineering. I've worked in semiconductors, aerospace, and now telecom - all doing engineering related work. (Not necessarily doing the heavy lifting, but managing the projects that do)</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>I like how it gives you a chance to meet people from all over the world. You never know who you might connect with and what that might lead to. Being early in my career, I like to read other people's perspectives and journeys.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>You can only connect with those chosen for the Listserve emails.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I'm not sure where it could lead, but trying something new and potentially being a part of building something great sounds exciting. </p>

### Age
<p>What did you hope the result would be of creating the Listserve?</p>
