### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>I like to go listen to live music, hike, take photos, bird watch, find good wine and coffee.</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>I know about non-profit work and serving communities who don't always have opportunities available to live a decent and happy life.</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>I like learning other people's perspectives, things that they think about or worry about, and reading strange stories that have happened to people. </p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>I don't like when people start with, "I don't know what to write" or "I'm only 20 something and don't have much to share." I think everyone does and if they could just share anything about themselves it would be interesting.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I want to help create something cool. I don't think I create enough.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>What are the major trends you have you observed from the listserve people?</p>
