### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>run long distances, travel, write, and support local politics</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>enterprise software, corporate finance</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>the opportunity to hear a stranger's most pressing thoughts</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>that it has become repetitive: it turns out that with a large audience, people tend to write about the same things. love, family, and hardship are most common and have become a bit of tired topics.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>i'd like to explore ways to increase engagement in the listserve community. to create incentives and structures for both writers and listeners to follow up and talk, work, and learn together.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>how will you know when this project is finished?</p>
