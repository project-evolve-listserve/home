### What do you know the most about?
<p>Social Media Strategy
London</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>The randomness of it, and how unexpected it is. You never know what you'll get</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>Emails in which people are talking about a charitable cause they believe in.

Maybe this makes me a bad person, but I am always more interested in the way people think, how they feel, or hearing their stories.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>Your email hooked me, and design thinking sounds interesting. Also I'm passionate about the Listserve and would be interested in whatever direction it takes next</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>Do you track open rates based on subject lines? What did you find?</p>
