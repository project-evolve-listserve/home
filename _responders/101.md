### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>I enjoy reading, watching movies and TV, talking with my husband and kids, and losing myself on the web just going where my mind takes me.</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Marketing and human behavior.  I a little about a lot of things because my interests range quite wide, but not always very deep!</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>It's interesting to see what pops up each day, it's so varied and sometimes quite personal.  I like that it's random and there are no rules about what you are 'supposed' to share.  </p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>I never get picked!  There really isn't anything I don't like, per se, some posts are more interesting than others but I think that goes with the territory.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I'm curious where it will go, and it's interesting to me to see where it might lead.  I've mostly been a passive viewer of the listserve, even when people ask for connection I never give it, so here's me, throwing myself out in the world to see what it brings back.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>Again, why don't you ever choose me?</p>
