### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>I chase my kids all over the house and play video games in my free time.</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>I have built my career around a passion for design and people. I am creative director at a development consultancy that specializes in UI and UX design. I have started and successfully exited (i.e., cashed out) a company, built brands, and more. I also make a really mean grilled cheese sandwich.</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>I love the opportunity to hear stories from other people, particularly people that I seem to share some commonalities with in other parts of the world.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>There is a lot of content that I really just don't care about. I typically decide within a few lines if I'm going to keep reading or not.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>The Listserve has been really interesting to be a part of and the idea of learning with other people to create something new is really compelling.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>nan</p>
