<p>I like to draw, practice my hand-lettering, read, collect succulents, run, do yoga occasionally, and go to Happy Hours.</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Graphic and web design, writing, lettering and typography, television and movies probably. Harry Potter.</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>I like reading people's thoughts on random subjects.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>Sometime they're a bit long, and I don't have time to read them everyday, so my backlog is a little overwhelming.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>The design thinking part really caught my eye. Also, I thought it would be fun to have pen pals.</p>

### Age
<p>What do people talk about most often in their Listserves? Is there a common theme that was unexpected?</p>
