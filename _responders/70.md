### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>i love reading, looking for facts about books, movies and the world of harry potter
sometimes i take time to learn how to code (html)</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>i'm not a very confident person, so my first thought was 'nothing', 
but i have a wide interest:
- in people's needs and wants 
- facts about random stuff 

 maybe theres a big list of stuff i know very well but in everything that comes to my mind i see spots where i might be lacking important info

</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>That it gives voice to random people all over the word</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>that i dont know the detais of how the people are selected</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I like new things, i want to start being part of something outside of my little world and i'm guessing i'll learn stuff that i wouldn't learn at school or somewhere

and i'm taking a class of entrepreneurship at college and i would love to wide my knowledge about real life situations

and i'm curious</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p><< can you give me inspiration when i get my winning ticket at listserve ?>></p>
