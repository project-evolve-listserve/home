### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>I like to find new restaurants/coffee shops/activities and give them a shot. My favorite so far has been drum lessons (all a weeks frustrations out in 30 minutes). My least favorite was a Goruck challenge (so. fucking. disorganized.).</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Movie trivia, especially films from 1992-present.</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>I like seeing lots of people doing something they'd only ever imagined. Its like watching improv over email every day.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>Seems like lots of people lately have the misconception that they have to be profound, or that they need to include commentary about the Listserve as a concept. </p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I always like to be involved. Specifically, I'd like to help generate new ideas for the Listserve and help grow the audience, both in size and engagement level. </p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>How does each person respond emotionally to the daily emails?</p>
