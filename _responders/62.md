### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>What is the grand plan, or first up - is there a grand plan that could underpin the contribution (probably answer - No it is about people sharing what is important and relevant to them at the time of getting the lottery email - so what design needs to go into that?)</p>
