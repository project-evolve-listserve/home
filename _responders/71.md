### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>I like to think a lot if that makes sense, I find fun in just thinking and beyond that, my first love, is service, I love to serve in any manner possible, I truly believe that a huge part of our purpose here on earth is to serve those around us. but more boringly, I like to read (especially dystopian novels), I want to be a donut connoisseur and I signed up for a 10K that is in January. </p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>In terms of technology, I would like to believe that I am an expert googler, I am usually able to find any and everything on google. I think that is a talent. More seriously, project development (service related projects) from a grassroots level. </p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>I love reading and learning about other people's lives. It is a pretty interesting platform for people to tell you anything even the most intimate things, and you are just a stranger willing to read.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>I dont</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>It sounded awesome when I read the email and again, I love the whole idea of the listserve. I wish my response was deeper. </p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>How?</p>
