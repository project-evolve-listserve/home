### What do you know the most about?
<p>i would with SharePoint 2010 teaching our users how to get the most out of it for their websites</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>getting different recommendations for music, video, books, ...
each email can be like a short story
i like to see what motivates people</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>i cant keep up wtih the daily messages - i think i'd prefer getting emails less frequently - either once a week with a listing of each subject line, or just fewer overall</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>i thought if someone identified a problem - say this 'family in my home town is going through difficult time and needs help' - we could come up with ways to help them, donations of things or money.
or find answers to other more broad problems in the world - just brainstorming with such a diverse group would be interesting</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>i'd like to see a map showing of the number of people from each location and maybe some demographics of age/sex of all the members</p>
