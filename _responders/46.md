### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>I enjoy reading (everything -- books, newspapers, comics), playing sports, spending time with friends, and cooking.</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>I don't have a true area of expertise to be honest. I'm a student studying business and Spanish, but I really enjoy public speaking and current events (I'm on the Model United Nations team and am a former debater).</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>I love that people are so willing to share intimate details with the world.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>That sometimes is feels like a way for a lot of people to share sad stories without them having a message for all of us. I'm glad they feel comfortable getting their story out there and allowing us to help them grieve, but I'd love to know something about the person that allows me to grieve with them.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>It honestly just seemed like a cool idea.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>What posts get the most resposnes</p>
