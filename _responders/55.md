### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Well, I run my own company, and it's small, so free time and work time tend to blend together. But travel always tops the free time list.  </p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>How human nature affects business.  
Radio.  (RIP) 
And marketing.  </p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>It's great to hear voices from around the world.  And since I'm part of the older demographic in the Listserve, I get solid insight into what younger people are saying...and thinking.  And I hear about new music that hasn't been on my radar.  </p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>A majority of Listservians seem to be following the same model.  C'mon kids, step up, step out and SAY SOMETHING.  

I think just one person has suggested a gathering of others in the group...in Brooklyn a year or so ago.  How come this doesn't happen more often?  (And I wonder how that gathering went??)

</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>The potential is huge.  Even without knowing what will occur, there's lots of upside to this.  </p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>Who's responsible?</p>
