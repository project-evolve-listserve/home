### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Read, learn new stuff, write code, make things that other people find useful.</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Web development, server admin, computational linguistics.</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>That it exposes me to a pretty wide range of people. Fb's feed, Twitter's stream, even my preferred news site all give me a biased view of things.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>The liars and the hypocrites. It's not the Listserve's fault, it's just I don't like those people, but I'm glad the Listserve censors nothing (AFAIK)</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>Because people with one really good idea sometimes come up with more good ideas.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>Do you censor any of the submissions? Some people are far worse than the worst of the Listserve emails so far, but it's a big black box up there in Olympus, so I wouldn't be any wiser if you did.</p>
