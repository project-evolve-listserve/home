### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>Each day bumping into someone random, and seeing what's on in his or her head, vis a vis his the email in your inbox. </p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>Some people just don't get it. Quality is up and down. </p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>Because I think there is something powerful that can be done with the right people who are creative and interested in doing something meaningful, and are ok with working with strangers and comfortable things</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
