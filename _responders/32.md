### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Travel, explore, meet new people, sit in coffee shops, read, listen to ted talks, binge watch Netflix, hot yoga & eat chocolate.</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Healthcare, healthcare regulations, pharmaceuticals, neuroscience (science in general), psychology & cognitive neuroscience. </p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>I like that the Listserve gives you the ability to connect with someone and not expect anything in return. It makes you think about something that might think not normally come across; its human empathy its in purest form. </p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>I think the Listserve isn't living up to its full potential..which leads me to the next question. </p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I think people are our greatest resource. Our mind has so much potential and imagine what we could do with that potential x 200 (or more!). I think this project can help accomplish just that. </p>

### Age
<p>How did you come up with this idea?</p>
