### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Run, play with my dog, hike, watch movies, read, bake, solo dance parties</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>Plants, ecophysiology, academia, psychology, a select few actors and musicians
</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>I like how non-commital it is. If i get an email that's too long or doesn't catch me with the subject or first sentence, I can skip it. I love hearing other peoples' stories.</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>Some people just go on and on and on and on about seemingly universal but uninteresting things</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I would love to learn to participate in such a project and use the ideas in my own pursuit of a Ph.D.</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>What were your expectations of the listserve and how did the results compare?</p>
