### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>I enjoy gaming in my PC, learning programming, playing guitar, inline skating and yoga</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>I'll say programming and data analysis, even though I'm still very novice in both subjects.</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>The little stories some people share is what comes to mind. Looking back at some of the emails that I've archived, the 2 common themes I find are: emails from people with whom I can relate and emails from people whose lifes/choices/attitudes I wish I had.
Oh, and there're lots of life advice in there :)</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>Life advice that I do not agree with.</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>Mostly because it makes me uncomfortable. It entails working remotely with people I never met on a cool subject I don't know much about.</p>

### Age
<p>Is there anything I could write about that would be useful/interesting to all the people reading?</p>
