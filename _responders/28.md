### What do you like to do in your free time?
<p>Read fiction and non-fiction (history, social change & sociology)</p>

### What do you know the most about?
<p>How activist movements succeed.</p>

### What do you like about the Listserve?
<p>serendipity</p>

### What do you NOT like about the Listserve?
<p>advice and babbling</p>

### Why are you interested in this project?
<p>I guess the same curiousity that brought me to the listserve</p>

### If there were Listserve 'Gods' and you could ask them a question, what would it be?
<p>What the disribution of respondents was. I understand that many posts get 80-200 responses. Is there a mere community of say 300 people that respond often, or is there a long tail, with 1,000 among the respondents?

BTW, you're not posting these results online, are you?</p>
